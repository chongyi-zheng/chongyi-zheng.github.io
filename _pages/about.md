I am a PhD student in [Computer Science](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/) at [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/) advised by [Benjamin Eysenbach](https://ben-eysenbach.github.io/). I am interested in developing <b>reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms</b> that can leverage prior knowledge, reason over long horizons, and gather information in a unsupervised manner. To this end, I work on unsupervised RL, goal-conditioned RL, and representation learning for control. I completed my M.S. from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) advised by [Ruslan Salakhutdinov](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/) and received my bachelor’s degree from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/). I have had the great opportunity to collaborate with [Sergey Levine](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/).
